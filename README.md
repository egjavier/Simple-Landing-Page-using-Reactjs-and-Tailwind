# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React + Vite

Followed a tutorial about ReactJS. I am new to react so I wnated to create as much project as I can to learn how it works. I also have no idea how to use tailwind. But after the tutorial that I follwed by @codecommerce, I realiase how good it is. I think I will now use tailwind instead of bootstrap. In terms of learning react, I learned components and some shortcut keys like 'rfce'.
